## Dotfile

#### git

Just copy to ~/, bashrc has by default .profile

```
cp .profile ~/
```

Linux or Mac

```
cd Linux
sh setup.sh
```

## Package manager

- Install Homebrew &mdash;to `$HOME/.homebrew` instead of /usr/local:

      git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git $HOME/.homebrew

- Run `which brew` to confirm the one in home directory is picked up.
- Run `brew analytics off`

## Installing software via Homebrew

All software installed on the system must be listed in `.Brewfile`. This is
symlinked at `~/.Brewfile` and used by `brew bundle`.

To install all the software, add it to `.Brewfile` and run:

    brew bundle --global

Some stuff will take long, in that case, identify which packages and update
`.Brewfile` to install them with `args: ['force-bottle']` or do a one-off
`brew install --force-bottle [pkg]` install.

- VSCode:
  - Install "Settings Sync" extension and reload.
  - Run '> Sync: Download Settings'
  - Enter gist ID in `vscode.sync` file to prompt.
  - Once extensions are installed 'Reload' (or Restart)
  - Run '> Sync: Update/Upload Settings'
  - Create a token with 'gist' permissions and save it to the prompt
  - Wait for the Sync Summary.
