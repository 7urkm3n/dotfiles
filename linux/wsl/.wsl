# Disable Windows 10/11 ENVs in WSL
# WSL uses the file /etc/wsl.conf inside each Linux VM's filesystem to configure its behavior. Add the following configuration settings (explained here) to /etc/wsl.conf, creating that file if necessary:

# sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
# [interop]
# appendWindowsPath = false


# powerShell command to see available ENV in windows!!!
# can be used few more such as Dart, Flutter etc... 
# $Env:PATH -split ';'

# WSL export for explorer.exe 
export PATH="/mnt/c/Windows:$PATH"

# WSL export for VScode, code
export PATH="/mnt/c/Users/rgurd/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin:$PATH"
